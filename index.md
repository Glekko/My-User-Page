## **Introduction**
Hi, I'm Kevin Wong, a programmer with some experience in **C++** and **Java**. I'm also interested in video games, reading, and Cyber Security.

Here are some links to bigger images of my PC.

### **Some More Background**
I dipped my toes into learning to code when I was in my freshman year oh high school. I had touched some XHTML and CSS, which when I look back on it now was a very inefficient time. Lot's of copy and pasting because I didn't have an understanding of the greater tools I could use. I never really kept up with web development and lost sight of programming in general until I hit college. While I still enjoy programming, I'm not sure if it's the path I want to pursue. Recently, I've been doing research on Cyber Security and the different jobs and requirements to enter the field. I've always liked the idea of protecting something online, and it helps that I consider myself pretty paranoid when it comes to online interactions.

### **Important Qualities I Bring**
- A willingness to _listen to others_ and their ideas.
- A _lack of ego_ and self-importance over others.
- A willingess to _learn and adapt_ to new things.

### **Long Term Goals**
1. Instill in myself proper and correct practices to facilitate better team work and discipline.
2. Make the transition to Cyber Security.

### **Short Term Tasks**
- [ ] Self-study for the _CompTia A+ Certification__
- [ ] Self-study for the _CompTia Network+ Certification_
- [ ] Self-study for the _CompTia Security+ Certification_
- [ ] Start experimenting with Hackathons and the like
- [x] Obtain the materials to start studying 


## **Motivational Quote**
> "Yesterday is history, Tomorrow is a mystery, but Today is a gift. That is why it is called the present." ~Master Oogway

The reason I like this quote is because the message is very simple, and it also has a Dad joke as part of the wisdom. That checks all the boxes for me! We can't control what has happened or what will happen (not truly), so we should focus on the present and cherish each moment. 

## **Important Commands**
Some important git commands that I'm listing here to remind myself of them in the future. 
```
`git commit -m` //commits changed with a message

`git add --all` //stages all changes

`git push --all` //pushes all branches
```
